        <p> I’m Kelly Zhou, a sophomore studying Computer Science at The University of Texas at Dallas.</p>
        <p> I’ve always been passionate about design ever since I was a young child. Instead of dropping me off at daycare, my parents would drop me off at an art studio where I would learn how to draw on walls and other unconventional surfaces.  </p>
        <p> During quarantine (like many of us), I decided to learn a new skill, so I picked up coding. I fell in love with code after printing my first “hello world,” leading me to pursue a degree in CS at UTD. Here, I hope to continue learning how to further my coding skills and combine them with my passion for art.
