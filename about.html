        <p> I’m Kelly a sophomore studying Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas. </p>
        <p> I’ve always been passionate about design even since I was a young. Instead of dropping me off at daycare my parents would drop me off at an art studio where would learn how to draw on walls and other unconventional surfaces.  </p>
        <p> During quarantine like many of us I decided to learn a new skill and so I picked up coding. I fell in love with code after printing my first “hello world”, leading me to pursue a degree in CS at UTD. Here I hope to continue learning how to further my coding skills, and combine them with my passion for art. </p>
